# WateringWizard

This is a prototyping project is designed to notify users when their plants have low water levels. The project consisted of a physical device placed in a the plant's pot, which monitors soil moisture levels. The goal was to send the real-time data from the device to the website, but due to time constraints, this was not implemented in the final version of the prototype.

The website is coded in **Typescript**, taking advantage of **Next.js** and **React** for a fast and responsive user-interface. Styling was handled with **Tailiwnid CSS** and Flexbox to create flexible responsive containers. The backend utilizes **Firebase** to enable authentication and real-time data handling. 

The application allows users to view detailed information about their plants in each room of their house.
The information displayed includes:

- **Scientific Name**: The botanical name of the plant for identification.
- **Days Since Watered**: Tracks the number of days since the plant was last watered.
- **Last Watered Date**: Records the most recent date when the plant was watered.
- **Soil Moisture Level**: Indicates the current moisture level of the soil as a percentage.
- **Watering Reminder**: Suggests the number of days remaining until the plant needs watering.
- **Image**: Displays a photo of the plant.
